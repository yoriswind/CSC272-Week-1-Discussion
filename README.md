Difference between Class and Object

When I think about objects and classes, I see a class as a blueprint and an object as the actual thing built from that blueprint. A class tells you what ingredients (data) and steps (methods) are needed. But the object is the actual dish made from that recipe. So a class defines how something should look or behave, while an object is a specific version of that thing in use. For example, if I create a Car class, Iâ€™m just describing what a car should be like. But when I instantiate a myCar or yourCar object, it uses that Car class recipe to make the myCar or yourCar object. The class stays the same, but each object can have its own unique details, like color or speed. So overall, the class defines, but the object is the existence of a class in the heap.
